        <strong>Bagrawiyah, Sudan –</strong> More than 200km from the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the remains of an ancient city rise from the arid and inhospitable terrain like a science-fiction film set. Nestled between sand dunes, the secluded pyramids
        seem to have been forgotten by the modern world, with no nearby restaurants or hotels to cater to tourists.
    </p>
